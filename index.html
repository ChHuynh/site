	So while Coming up with what I wanted to do for my website, I remembered that I used <a href="http://howlongtobeat.com/">this website</a> to keep track of games that I play, as well as look at general data to see how long on average it should take a person to complete any given game. I decided that it would be fun to try my hand at something similar. one thing i noticed about this site is that it uses a lot of imaages. this site uses the tag class a lot, and along with it some sort of definition. just by looking at it, it sounds like its something that you can define and then make everything with the same class have some sort of attribute or something like that. The site overall is really user friendly and has every box labeled with the kind of functionality that you can infer.
